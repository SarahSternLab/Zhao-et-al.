## Summary

The study investigates how interoceptive signals targeting the insular cortex influence the learning and modulation of feeding behavior. Using a combination of neural tracing, optogenetics, and behavioral analysis, the authors identify a pathway by which visceral inputs affect higher-order decision-making related to food intake.
